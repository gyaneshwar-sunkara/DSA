## XOR



## Multiple

A multiple in math are the numbers you get when you multiply a certain number by an integer.

Example:

*   multiples of 5 are: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

Remember:

* A number is also a multiple of itself.

## Factor/Divisor

A factor in math are numbers you can multiply to get a certain number.

Example:

* To get the number 8, you can multiply 2 x 4. So, 2 and 4 are factors of 8.

Remember:

* 1 is the smallest divisor of any number.
* Number itself is the largest divisor of the number.

## LCM

The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

## GCD/GCF/HCF

There are several methods to find the greatest common divisor of given two numbers.

* Prime factorisation method
* Long division method
* Euclid’s division algorithm

Example:

Find the greatest common divisor (or HCF) of 128 and 96.

By the method of **prime factorisation**,

128 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2

96 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3

HCF (128, 96) = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x2 = 32

(OR)

By the method of **long division**,

Hence, 32 is the HCF of 128 and 96.

(OR)

By **Euclid’s division algorithm**,

128 = 96 x 1 + 32

96 = 32 x 3 + 0

Hence, the HCF of 128 and 96 is 32.

Use Case:

Two rods are 22 m and 26 m long. The rods are to be cut into pieces of equal length. Find the maximum length of each piece.

HCF or GCD is the required length of each piece.

22 = 2 x 11

26 = 2 x 13

HCF or the greatest common divisor = 2

Hence, the required maximum length of each piece is 2 m.


## LCM - GCD Relation

$$\mathrm {lcm} (a,b) = \frac {|a \cdot b|}{gcd (a,b)}$$

lcm =	least common multiple

gcd	=	greatest common divisor

a,b	=	non-zero integers

## Important Points

* Every **Composite Number**, i.e. a number with more than one factor can be written as a product of prime numbers.
